in this file, the "app.get..." and "app.post..." are known as endpoints. theyre literally what people refer to as API. it is whatever you define/write there that you wil get when you access the API.

so if you want to access any of the API, the link will be the server address `http://localhost:3000` where localhost is like the server address. so your get or post api will be  `http://localhost:3000/api/data` for get and `http://localhost:3000/api/post` for posting data. you'll get more insigst in the VN


to install the packages, run `npm install` to install all packages found in the package.json. AFTER INSTALLATION, RUN `npm run dev` to run the server using nodemon that auto refreshes your server when you make changes to your code
